Index of Personal Public Repositories
=====================================
IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: Most of these repositories do not actually hold any code, nor do they attempt to persuade any given individual to think or feel or do anything. These are artistic works, Documentation if you will in the form of Github Repositories for Art-based Research Projects. If there should be any doubt whatsoever about any of this, then either don't read it, move on, or you can contact me directly and I will remove anything that does not fit my highest standards of decency and prudence. I would not want to inadvertently post anything online that could harm anyone. In fact, the reason I created these was to try to find ways to make the world a safer place. With that being said, I have gone at great lengths to ensure that no secret messages accidentally appear anywhere in my work. But there's a limit to what I can do. If someone is sick enough to try to read things into my work where there is nothing to read, I can't be held accountable for their thoughts or actions. But like I said, if anyone so much as suspects that there might accidentally be something anywhere on this account that could be misinterpreted, please contact me immediately and I will repair the ambiguity, disambiguate further so that no wrong interpretations can be made of what is mostly just text in Markdown format. But it is public, and I must take responsibility for it.
