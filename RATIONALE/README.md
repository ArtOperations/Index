RATIONALE
=========
* This is an explanation of the rationale behind everything that I, A.G., do as a person and as an artist in my illustrious artistic practise.
* Imagine for a moment that you are homeless. You have no worldly possessions except a few things.
  * You have some basic units of clothing, you have shoes, and you have a GitHub account.
  * That's all you need. I will explain soon. GitHub is my home now. It is my most critical possession as a person and as an artist. It is what allows me to be held most accountable for all that I say and do, even my thoughts are being scrutinized.
